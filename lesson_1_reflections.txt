Like the video shows, it is very helpful to finding bugs, and fix them.

Also I believe it is also very easy to redo changes in the code,
which is a lot more convinence when coding

2) it can let us look back what have changed, and to understand what is good
change and what maybe not so good. It gave us a sense of progression and changes
which we can look into

3) Pro: each commit is meaningful, likely compilable. 
Con: one may forget to commit and lose a version

4) I think it depends on what is the purpose of that VC system. if its for coding like
GIT, it is making sense that saving multiple files.
However for google Doc, people usually work on one file. therefore separation is reasonable
